I have tried to do as you told me to do but I ended up at the point where I just able to create application which can be run in background and at initial level it will be hidden and when you click on the notification which I have creted it will open the application and unhide it. I tried to complete all the requirements but the broadcast couldn't handle volume listner and I am not sure how can I listen to volume button when the application is in foreground
